# Data Availability Statement

This repository accompanies the study titled "Analysis of 30 Chromosome-Level *Drosophila* Genome Assemblies Reveals Dynamic Evolution of Centromeric Satellite Repeats." Below is a summary of the data generated and utilized in this research, along with their availability:

## Generated Data

- **Hi-C and RNA-Seq Data**:
  - **Description**: Hi-C data were generated from whole female flies of 22 *Drosophila* species to scaffold existing genome assemblies to chromosome-level quality. Additionally, RNA-Seq data from ovaries were produced for these 30 species to aid in genome annotation.
  - **Access**: These datasets are deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject number [PRJNA1119277](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1119277).

- **Genome Assemblies**:
  - **Description**: The scaffolded genome assemblies for the 30 *Drosophila* species are available through NCBI Datasets under the same BioProject number.
  - **Access**: Refer to BioProject [PRJNA1119277](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1119277) for detailed information.

## Publicly Available Data

- **Hi-C Data for Additional *Drosophila* Species**:
  - **Description**: Publicly available Hi-C datasets for eight *Drosophila* species were incorporated into our analyses.
  - **Access**: Details, including accession numbers and references, are provided in Table S1 of the manuscript.

## Code Availability

- **Custom Scripts and Code**:
  - **Description**: All custom scripts and code used in this study, including those for scaffolding, annotation, and evolutionary analyses, are available in this GitHub repository.
  - **License**: The code is released under the MIT License.
